/*
JavaScript is a dynamically typed language. This means that variable types are determined at runtime, 
and you do not need to explicitly declare the type of a variable before using it. You can assign different 
types of values to a variable during its lifetime.

For example, in JavaScript, you can do the following:

let x = 10; // x is now a number
x = "Hello"; // x is now a string
x = true; // x is now a boolean
On the other hand, statically typed languages require you to declare the variable's type explicitly, 
and the type checking is done at compile-time, before the code is executed.

Languages like Java, C++, and TypeScript are statically typed, and they require you to specify the 
variable type explicitly when declaring them:

int x = 10; // x is a variable of type int
String name = "John"; // name is a variable of type String
JavaScript's dynamic typing allows for more flexibility but can lead to potential runtime errors 
if not handled carefully. Static typing, on the other hand, provides better type safety at the 
cost of some initial verbosity and strictness.
